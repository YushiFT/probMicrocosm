PMCosm: Probabilistic model for microbial-cosmos
=======

IMPORTANT NOTE: We have transferred all source code to </span> <https://github.com/YushiFT/PMCosm>. This repository only serves as the reference for our paper (Tang et al. 2022) under review by ISME Communications. 

The `PMCosm` package implements statistical inferences for microbial ecology analysis. This package provides methods for 

* categorizing the admixed structure of microbial communities,
* detecting influential microbes in both engineered and natural environments,
* evaluating sub-communities' preferences of life strategies,
* identifying causal relationship between microbes' metabolism functions and fluctuations of surrounding environments,
* predicting the community composition and structure for a given local environment.
